# Advent of Code 2023

I decided to solve, document and publish my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles in 2023 using React.

I thought it would be a fun way to refresh my React knowledge, and try some new things like:

-   using Github Actions to build a CI/CD pipeline to automatically (re)deploy the application on commit.
-   using markdown files to store website content
-   ...
-
